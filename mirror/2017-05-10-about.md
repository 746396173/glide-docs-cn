To allow Glide's functionality to be extended, Glide provides support for integration libraries. Integration libraries range in size and scope, but commonly do things like integrate with networking libraries or add support for new decode types. Placing extensions in separate libraries allows users to select the functionality that's relevant to them while reducing their APK size and app footprint by excluding functionality that's not as useful. 

This section provides information about each available integration library maintained by Glide and brief instructions on how to include it.
